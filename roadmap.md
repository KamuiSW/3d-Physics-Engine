# 3D Game Engine Roadmap

A C#-based 3D game engine with realistic physics and Unity-like editor features.

---

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Objective**: Setup foundational systems and project management.

### 1.1 Project Setup
- Create solution/project structure
- Implement basic serialization (JSON/YAML) for project files
- Build a project manager application:
  - New project creation wizard
  - Project list with paths
  - Project metadata storage

### 1.2 Window Framework
- Choose GUI framework (Avalonia, WinForms/WPF, or custom)
- Create dockable window system
- Implement basic editor layout:
  - Hierarchy panel
  - Inspector panel
  - Asset browser
  - Scene viewport

---

## Phase 2: Scene System & Editor Basics
**Objective**: Create core scene management and editing tools.

### 2.1 Entity Component System (ECS)
- Implement GameObject class
- Create component architecture
- Serialization/deserialization for scenes

### 2.2 Scene Viewport
- WASD camera controls
- Mouse look (orbit/pan/zoom)
- Gizmos for object manipulation
- Selection system (click/pick)

### 2.3 Hierarchy & Inspector
- Right-click context menu for object creation
- Component property editing
- Script attachment/detachment
- Prefab system basics

---

## Phase 3: 3D Rendering Pipeline
**Objective**: Build modern 3D rendering capabilities.

### 3.1 Graphics Foundation
- Choose rendering API (Vulkan/DirectX/OpenGL via OpenTK)
- Implement shader system (GLSL/HLSL)
- Basic mesh rendering
- Camera system (perspective/orthographic)

### 3.2 Advanced Rendering
- PBR materials
- Dynamic lighting (point/directional/spot)
- Shadow mapping
- Post-processing stack

### 3.3 Asset Pipeline
- Model import system (FBX/OBJ)
- Texture loading (PNG/JPG)
- Material editor
- Shader hot-reloading

---

## Phase 4: Physics Engine
**Objective**: Implement realistic physics simulation.

### 4.1 Collision Detection
- AABB/OBB collision
- Sphere vs Mesh
- Raycasting
- Collision layers

### 4.2 Dynamics
- Rigidbody implementation
- Force/torque system
- Constraints (hinge/spring)
- Collision resolution

### 4.3 Advanced Physics
- Soft body dynamics
- Vehicle physics
- Buoyancy/fluids
- GPU acceleration

---

## Phase 5: Scripting & Gameplay
**Objective**: Create scripting system and runtime.

### 5.1 C# Integration
- Script compilation pipeline
- Component lifecycle hooks
- API exposure:
  - Input
  - Physics
  - Rendering

### 5.2 Editor Integration
- Script asset type
- Public variable inspection
- Double-click to edit (VS Code/IDE)
- Hot-reload support

### 5.3 Game Runtime
- Play/Stop/Pause controls
- Scene transition
- Physics stepping modes
- Profiling tools

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Optimization
**Objective**: Refine editor UX and performance.

### 6.1 Editor Features
- Undo/Redo system
- Multi-selection
- Asset previews
- Plugin system

### 6.2 Performance
- Frustum culling
- Level-of-detail (LOD)
- Multithreaded physics
- Memory pooling

### 6.3 Deployment
- Windows build pipeline
- Asset bundling
- Player settings
- Debug console

---

## Phase 7: Advanced Features
**Objective**: Add professional-grade capabilities

### 7.1 Tooling
- Terrain editor
- Animation system
- Particle editor
- Navmesh baking

### 7.2 Rendering Enhancements
- Global illumination
- CSM for shadows
- Compute shaders
- VR support

### 7.3 Physics Extensions
- Cloth simulation
- Destruction system
- Ragdoll physics
- GPU particles

## Development Principles
1. **Test-Driven**: Validate each subsystem with unit tests
2. **Modular**: Keep systems decoupled
3. **Documentation**: Maintain API references and user guides
4. **Performance**: Profile critical paths regularly
5. **Community**: Plan for modding/extension support
