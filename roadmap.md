# Roadmap for Building a 3D Game Engine with Physics in C#

## Prerequisites
- **C# Proficiency**: Master OOP, delegates, async/await, and memory management.
- **3D Mathematics**: Vectors, matrices, quaternions, and linear algebra.
- **Graphics Fundamentals**: Rendering pipeline, shaders (GLSL/HLSL), and GPU basics.
- **Physics Knowledge**: Newtonian mechanics, collision detection, and rigid body dynamics.
- **Tools**: Git, Visual Studio, and profiling tools (e.g., JetBrains dotTrace).

## Phase 1: Core Engine Architecture
### 1.1 Game Loop & Time Management
- Implement a fixed/variable timestep loop using `Stopwatch` for precision.
- **Checkpoint**: Stable loop updating at 60/120 FPS.

### 1.2 Entity Component System (ECS)
- Design `Entity`, `Component`, and `System` base classes.
- **Checkpoint**: Spawn/remove entities with transform components.

### 1.3 Resource Management
- Create a pipeline to load models, textures, and shaders (e.g., `.obj`, `.png`).
- **Checkpoint**: Load and cache a textured 3D model.

### 1.4 Input Handling
- Abstract keyboard/mouse/gamepad input via `System.Windows.Input` or SDL2 bindings.
- **Checkpoint**: Move an entity using WASD.

## Phase 2: 3D Graphics Pipeline
### 2.1 Rendering Foundation
- Use OpenGL/Vulkan via OpenTK or Silk.NET.
- **Checkpoint**: Render a colored triangle.

### 2.2 Model Rendering
- Implement vertex buffers, VAOs, and basic shaders.
- **Checkpoint**: Render a textured 3D model.

### 2.3 Camera System
- Build perspective (FOV, aspect ratio) and view (look-at) matrices.
- **Checkpoint**: Orbit camera around a model.

### 2.4 Lighting
- Add ambient/directional/point lights with Phong shading.
- **Checkpoint**: Dynamic lighting on a scene.

---

## Phase 3: Physics Engine
### 3.1 Collision Detection
- Implement AABB/sphere/mesh collision with GJK/EPA.
- **Checkpoint**: Detect collisions between two cubes.

### 3.2 Collision Resolution
- Resolve impulses via manifold generation and penalty forces.
- **Checkpoint**: Boxes stack without sinking.

### 3.3 Rigid Body Dynamics
- Integrate forces/torque with Verlet or RK4.
- **Checkpoint**: Apply gravity and bounce.

### 3.4 Spatial Partitioning
- Add BVH or spatial grids for broad-phase optimization.
- **Checkpoint**: Handle 100+ colliding objects.

---

## Phase 4: Integration & Tools
### 4.1 Physics-Graphics Sync
- Sync transform components between systems.
- **Checkpoint**: Physics-driven object rendering.

### 4.2 Debug Tools
- Visualize colliders, normals, and physics properties.

### 4.3 Scene Editor
- Build a WinForms/Avalonia UI for entity placement and serialization (JSON/XML).

---

## Phase 5: Optimization & Advanced Features
- **Multithreading**: Job system for physics/rendering.
- **Memory**: Pool entities/avoid GC pressure.
- **Advanced Rendering**: Shadow mapping, PBR, post-processing.
- **Networking**: Basic multiplayer via Lidgren.

---

## Phase 6: Documentation & Community
- Write API docs (XML comments â†’ Sandcastle).
- Create demo projects (e.g., ragdolls, vehicle physics).
- Open-source on GitHub with issue tracking.

---

## Resources
- **Books**: 
  - _3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development_
  - _Game Physics Engine Development_
- **Tools**: 
  - OpenTK/Silk.NET for graphics
  - ImGui.NET for debug UIs
- **Communities**: r/gamedev, Stack Overflow, GameDev.net

## Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Scope Creep**: Start with cubes/spheres before meshes.
- **Math Errors**: Validate matrices/quaternions with unit tests.
- **C# Gotchas**: Minimize garbage with structs/object pooling.
